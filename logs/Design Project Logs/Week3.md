### Log 2: Beginning, Front, End

##### 12/20, Week 3 Update

#### Clear for Take Off

These past two weeks have been spent familiarizing myself with the Vue framework, finding a front end framework to use, and attempting to build a front end. 

I am happy to say I have now made it through the obligatory hair-pulling phase that comes with learning any new framework. There is still plenty of learning ahead of me, but I am now prepared to hit the ground running. 

One of my concerns leading into this project was my failing understanding of design, so I have decided to use a styled framework to save myself from making (some) bad design decisions. After quite a bit of research, I have settled on Quasar as it seems to be easy to pick up and clean in its appearance. 

Regarding my data collection, I have decided that, since I need a frontend eventually, I will build the frontend for the data collection. Then, while data is being collected, it should be an easy transition to the full app's frontend. They are basically the same, anyway. While this does delay the start of data collection, as long as I have the survey live by the end of January (hold me to this!), I will have 3 weeks to collect data. During that time, I will setup the Tensorflow structure and should be able to plug in the data seamlessly. 

Unfortunately for the project, I will be away on a cruise from 12/25 to 1/4 and unable to work on this during that time.  

The reality of how much time I have left is beginning to seep in and haunt every waking moment, though, so rest assured that upon my return I will be working in full throttle.
