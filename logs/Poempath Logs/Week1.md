### Log 1: Onto the next one

##### 3/16, Week 1 Update

#### Project: Complete, Career: Just getting started

I did it. poempath.com was live and represented MVP. I presented to the judges and received an A+. :tada: Then, I 
took a month and left this project alone. I have decided that I will try to pretty up my code and make the repo 
public so, even if my website will not be a commercial success, it can still be useful. 

These logs will mark my post-project attempt to polish, refactor, and optimize my codebase. 

#### How Did I Do?

(Here is where I will post my goal completion or lack thereof)

#### Goals for Week 1

- Merge the final project branch into master, or decide what to do regarding that
- Rebase commits and rename all commit messages to something sensible (imperative)
- Develop a clear plan for the site moving forward
