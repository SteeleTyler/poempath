#### It's Complicated

This week, I researched the basics of neural networks and machine learning. I have no prior knowledge of the subject, so it was difficult to get started. 
 
 I learned about the different languages and frameworks that can be used to build a neural network. Python is the most popular neural network language due to its power and ease of implementation. It is also feature packed with libraries built for heavy computation and machine learning. 

One such library, TensorFlow, appears to be a prime candidate for this application. It is a python framework designed to be a high-level interface for neural networks and machine learning. Given my problem scope involves text based classification and does not necessarily require precise calibration, I think TensorFlow will serve me well.  

Artificial neural networks are frameworks modeled after animal brains on which machine learning algorithms can run. The creation of a neural network using TensorFlow involves multiple phases. During the learning phase, the NN is fed information to be classified (images, data points) and the correct classifications. With this information, the NN creates connections that help it to better classify the input without any guidance. The NN then enters the training phase in which they are given more data without the outcome. Depending on the NN's accuracy, it may alter its classification methods.
